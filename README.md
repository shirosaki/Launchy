It is the most efficient way to open files, folders, websites,
and programs on your computer. Instead of having to browse the menus
to find an application, Launchy is a smart search program which tries
to guess which program or file you are looking for and will launch
it when you hit the enter key. It runs in background and appears when
the configured key combination is pressed (Ctrl+Space by default) or
the tray icon is clicked.

If you'd like to run a program with a second parameter then use tab. E.g. 
```
gedit [tab] ~/textfile.txt [tab] [return]
```
runs
```
gedit ~/textfile.txt
```

As there seems to be not many people work on this nice program I've tried to fix
the bugs and misssing feature request that I need. My main focus is on Launchy for Windows.
